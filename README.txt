Matrix calculator for Advanced Object Oriented Programming course in C++.

Currently work in progress, includes calculator functionality for square matrix inputs of strings in "[[n11,...,n1n]...[nn1,...,nnn]]" format.
Functionality is tested with Catch tests in squarematrix_tests.cpp and intelement_tests.cpp.

Lastly edited to use smart pointers.

Using Doxygen notation as required by the course.
